## Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @rpldy/uploader
```

## Details

The Uploader is the processing and queuing engine for React-Uploady.
It takes care of many things:

- hand data to the sender to be uploaded
- handle upload items and batches
- keep internal state of uploads and their statuses
- trigger external [events](../api/uploader#events)
- orchestrate concurrent uploads (when configured)
- group items into single request (when configured)
- supports [enhancers](../getting-started/concepts#enhancer) for custom functionality

When files are handed to the Uploader, it will represent each file as a [Batch Item](../getting-started/concepts#batch-item) and group them together in a [Batch](../getting-started/concepts#batch).

The uploader works well out of the box, but it can be configured with many [options](../api/uploader) to make it suit a myriad of use-cases.

If you're looking to integrate file upload with your React app, you'd probably want to head over to the [@rpldy/uploady page](rpldy-uploady).
