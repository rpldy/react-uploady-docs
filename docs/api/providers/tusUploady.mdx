## Feature Detection

Tus servers may broadcast the features ([extensions](https://tus.io/protocols/resumable-upload.html#protocol-extensions)) they support.
Uploady can query those and turn on/off certain features.
By default, it will not make this query. Querying can be turned on by passing `true` to the `featureDetection` prop.
