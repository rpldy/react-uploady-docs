See: [Uploady documentation](../..#props) for detailed list of upload options.


### retries

It's possible to have chunked uploads retry in case of failure.
By default, one chunk failing once will cause the entire upload to error.

## Events

Chunked Sender makes it possible to handle chunk life-time events.
See [uploader events](../../events) section on more info regarding how to register for events.

### CHUNK_EVENTS.CHUNK_START

Triggered when a chunk is about to be sent to the server

> This event is _[cancellable](../../events#cancellable-events)_

The event handler may return an object with the following shape:

```typescript
interface ChunkedOptions {
    chunked?: boolean;
    chunkSize?: number;
    retries?: number;
    parallel?: number;
}

type StartEventResponse = {
	url: string,
  sendOptions: ChunkedOptions
}
```

### CHUNK_EVENTS.CHUNK_FINISH

Triggered when a chunk has finished uploading

### Item Error

In case of chunk upload error in conjunction of using the [ITEM_ERROR](../../events/#itemError) or the
[useItemErrorListener](../../hooks/useItemErrorListener/) hook, it is possible to access the error information returned from the server like so:

```jsx
import { useItemErrorListener } from "@rpldy/uploady";

const MyComponent = () => {
    useItemErrorListener((item) => {
        console.log(`item ${item.id} failed -  status code:`, item.uploadResponse.chunkUploadResponse.status); //the status code returned by the server on the failed chunk
        console.log(`item ${item.id} failed -  msg:`, item.uploadResponse.chunkUploadResponse.response); //the response data (if) sent by the server on the failed chunk
    });

    //...
};
```
