In addition, all [UploadOptions](../../types#uploadoptions) props can be passed to ChunkedUploady.

See [Uploady documentation](../..#props) for detailed list of upload options.

All [chunked-sender options](../../enhancers/getChunkedEnhancer#options) are supported as well

:::note
Params prop that is set on the Destination or upload options is serialized (encoded according to Tus protocol) and sent as the value of the Upload-Metadata header.
:::

:::info
Custom headers set on the Destination will be sent (and override existing headers) with the Creation request
:::

## Feature Detection

Tus servers may broadcast the features ([extensions](https://tus.io/protocols/resumable-upload.html#protocol-extensions)) they support.
Uploady can query those and turn on/off certain features.
By default, it will not make this query. Querying can be turned on by passing `true` to the `featureDetection` prop.


## Resume Headers

These are (optional) headers that are only used for the resume (HEAD) request.
