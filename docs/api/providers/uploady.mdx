### Destination

```typescript
type Destination = {
    url?: string;
    filesParamName?: string;
    params?: Record<string, unknown>;
    headers?: Record<string, unknown>;
    method?: string;
};
```

The destination is how you tell Uploady (and the Uploader) where to upload to. In most cases, this means an HTTP endpoint.

There are a few Props such as: `params` and `method` that both Uploady accepts directly and can also be passed inside the Destination object.
The destination has the higher priority and will override the ones configured outside.

#### URL

The endpoint to make the request to

#### filesParamName

The name of the param in the upload request (default: input element's name)

See [inputFieldName](#inputfieldname)

#### params

collection of params to pass along with the upload

#### headers

collection of headers to add to the request

#### method

> Default: POST

The HTTP verb to use for the request

### inputFieldName

> Default: file

This is the name that will be assigned to the file input element rendered by Uploady.

### enhancer

```typescript
type UploaderEnhancer = (uploader: UploaderType, trigger: Trigger<any>) => UploaderType;
```

Registering an enhancer gives you access to the uploader instance and to the trigger method.
This is a powerful way to customize the uploader or its options.

The trigger method can be used to trigger(fire) custom events that can be listened to using the [listeners](#listeners) prop or the [on](../api/context#on) and [once](../api/context#once) context methods.

#### Extensions

Enhancers are the only time when external code can register an extension.
Extensions are objects that are added to an uploader instance under a specific name and can later be retrieved.
This is mainly used internally by the other providers.

See [Uploader Enhancers Guide](../guides/UploaderEnhancers) for more details

### fileFilter

```typescript
type FileFilterMethod = (file: File | string, index: number, files: File[] | string[]) => boolean | Promise<boolean | undefined> | undefined;
```

the file filter method is called on each item being uploaded (typically: File) and should return false (or a falsy value) in case it __shouldn't__ be added to the batch.

the filter method supports async (returning a promise) responses.

See [File Filter Guide](../guides/FileFilter)

### listeners

Makes it possible to pass an object map of key being the event name (ex: "BATCH-START") and the value being a handler function.
The event handlers passed using this object map will be registered using the Context's on method.

- See [Uploader Events](../api/constants#uploaderEvents)

- See [Passing listeners using props](../guides/UploaderEvents#listeners-props)

### Send Method {#sendMethod}

```typescript

export type SenderProgressEvent = {
    total: number;
    loaded: number;
}

type OnProgress = (e: SenderProgressEvent, objs: Record<string, unknown>[]) => void;

type SendMethod = (item: BatchItem[], url: string | undefined, options: SendOptions, onProgress?: OnProgress) => SendResult;
```

This is the method that will be called by the uploader when its time to start making upload requests.
The default send method comes from the [XHR Sender](../api/senders/xhrSender).

It's possible to replace the default method with any other sender that provides the same signature the uploader expects.

Providers like [Chunked-Uploady](../api/providers/chunked-uploady), use the ability to swap the send method in order to provide the one from their own sender.
ie: [Chunked-Sender](../api/senders/chunkedSender).

### formatServerResponseMethod

A function to create the batch item's uploadResponse from the raw xhr response.

- See [FormatServerResponseMethod](../api/types#formatserverresponsemethod)

If not provided, JSON responses will be parsed using [JSON.parse](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse) or be left as fis for anything else.

### customInput

Uploady render's a (hidden) file input that is used to show the file selection prompt to the user in order to select local files to upload.
In almost all cases that is the preferred way and therefore the default. In case you want to use your own file input, this can be achieved by setting the prop to true,
and using the [useFileInput hook](../api/hooks/useFileInput) to pass a ref to the custom element.

### clearPendingOnAdd {#clearPendingOnAdd}

When uploader is set up with `autoUpload = false`, files added (batches) will not automatically upload
and a call to [upload](../api/uploader#upload) is required.
Setting this option to true will remove previously added batch(es) and leave only the new one to upload.

### isSuccessfulCall

```typescript
type IsSuccessfulCall = (xhr: XMLHttpRequest) => boolean;
```

Uploady's [sender](../api/senders/xhrSender) treats server responses as successful when they have one of these status codes: 200, 201, 202, 203, 204.

In case you have a server that returns a different code or you want to specify your own logic to determine the success of the call, `isSuccessfulCall` gives you the chance to do so, overriding the default behavior.

:::info
The callback can be asynchronous
:::

```jsx
//determine successful call using custom status codes
const customIsSuccess = (xhr) => [308, 418].includes(xhr.status);

const App = () => {
	return (
		<Uploady isSuccessfulCall={customIsSuccess}>
		...
		</Uploady>
	);
};
```

### debug

> Default: false

Most of the time there is no need to use this flag. When setting to true it will make Uploady and other internal classes log debugging information to the console.

### fastAbortThreshold

> Default: 100

Added in [1.1.0](https://github.com/rpldy/react-uploady/releases/tag/v1.1.0)

Controls the way abort of multiple items (all or batch) is handled by the [Abort Enhancer](../packages/rpldy-abort).
When the count of items to abort it equal or higher than the threshold, the [fast](../api/enhancers/getAbortEnhancer#fast) abort mode is used.
If not, or when the threshold is set to 0, the [normal](../api/enhancers/getAbortEnhancer#normal) mode is used.

### userData

this can be anything you want to set. It is ignored by the Uploader and is provided as a convenience to pass
information around. For example, from the code initiating the upload and event handler.

```jsx
	//add userData for uploads started by this button:
	return <UploadButton userData="test"/>


	// somewhere else:
  useBatchStartListener((batch, options) => {
    console.log(
      `BATCH ${batch.id} started uploading. found userData = ${options.userData}`,
    );
  });
```
