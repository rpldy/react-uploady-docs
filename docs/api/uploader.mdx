:::info
See [uploady](.) page for more details on some of these options
:::

## Example

```javascript
import createUploader, { UPLOADER_EVENTS } from "@rpldy/uploader";

const uploader = createUploader({ destination: { url: "https://my-server.com/upload" }});

uploader.add([myFile1, myFile2], { autoUpload: false });

uploader.once(UPLOADER_EVENTS.BATCH_ADD, (batch) => {
	console.log(`NEW BATCH ADDED WITH ${batch.items.length} FILES`, batch);
});
```

## API

The Uploader API is typically used by internal logic of the various rpldy packages.
In a React environment, accessing the API should be done through the [Context API](../context#api).

### add

```typescript
type Add = (files: UploadInfo | UploadInfo[], addOptions?: UploadOptions) => Promise<void>

```

- See: [UploadInfo](../types#uploadinfo)
- See: [UploadOptions](../types#uploadoptions)

The way to add file(s) to be uploaded. Second parameters allows to pass different options than
the ones the instance currently uses for this specific batch. These options will be merged with current instance options.

### upload

```typescript
type Upload = (uploadOptions?: UploadOptions) => void
```

- See: [UploadOptions](../types#uploadoptions)

For batches that were added with `autoUpload = false`, the upload method must be called for the files to begin uploading.

### abort

```typescript
type Abort  = (id?: string) => void;
```

abort all files being uploaded or a single item by passing its ID

### abortBatch

(id: string) => void;

```typescript
type AbortBatch  = (id?: string) => void;
```

abort a specific batch by passing its ID

### update

```typescript
type Update = (updateOptions: CreateOptions) => UploaderType;
```

- See: [CreateOptions](../types#createoptions)
- See: [UploaderType](../types#uploadertype)


The `updateOptions` parameter will be merged with the instance's existing options
Returns the updated uploader instance

###	getOptions

```typescript
type GetOptions = () => CreateOptions;
```

- See: [CreateOptions](../types#createoptions)

Get the instance's upload options

###	clearPending

```typescript
type ClearPending = () => void;
```

Remove all batches that were added with `autoUpload = false`
and were not handed over to the sender

### on

```typescript
type On = (name: unknown, cb: EventCallback) => OffMethod
```

Register an event handler

### once

```typescript
type Once = (name: unknown, cb: EventCallback) => OffMethod
```

Register an event handler that will be called a maximum one time

### off

```typescript
type Off = (name: unknown, cb?: EventCallback) => void;
```

Unregister an existing event handler.
If handler function reference isn't provided, will unregister all handlers for the provided event name.

### registerExtension

```typescript
type RegisterExtension = (name: unknown, methods: { [key: string]: (...args: any[]) => void | unknown }) => void;
```

Extensions can only be registered by [uploader enhancers](../#enhancer).
If registerExtension is called outside an enhancer, an error will be thrown
Name must be unique. If not, an error will be thrown

### getExtension

```typescript
type GetExtension = (name: unknown) => Record<string, unknown>;
```

Retrieve a registered extension by its name

## Events

The Uploader will trigger lifecycle events for Batch and Batch Item.

Registering to handle events can be done using the uploader's _on()_ and _once()_ methods.
Unregistering can be done using _off()_ or by the return value of both _on()_ and _once()_.

```javascript
const batchAddHandler = (batch) => {};

const unregister = uploader.on(UPLOADER_EVENTS.BATCH_ADD, batchAddHandler);

unregister(); //is equivalent to the line below
uploader.off(UPLOADER_EVENTS.BATCH_ADD, batchAddHandler);
```

### Batch Events {#batch-events}

#### UPLOADER_EVENTS.BATCH_ADD

:::

#### UPLOADER_EVENTS.BATCH_START

Triggered when batch items start uploading

- Parameters: _(batch, options: CreateOptions)_

- See: [CreateOptions](../types#createoptions)

:::info
This event is _[cancellable](../events#cancellable-events)_

#### UPLOADER_EVENTS.BATCH_PROGRESS

Triggered every time progress data is received from the upload request(s)

- Parameters: _(batch)_

#### UPLOADER_EVENTS.BATCH_FINISH

Triggered when batch items finished uploading

- Parameters: _(batch)_

#### UPLOADER_EVENTS.BATCH_CANCEL

Triggered in case batch was cancelled from BATCH_START event handler

- Parameters: _(batch)_

#### UPLOADER_EVENTS.BATCH_ABORT

Triggered in case the batch was [aborted](#abortbatch)

- Parameters: _(batch)_

:::info
This event is _[cancellable](../events#cancellable-events)_
:::

#### UPLOADER_EVENTS.ITEM_FINISH

Triggered when item finished uploading successfully

- Parameters: _(item)_

The server response can be accessed through the item's _uploadResponse_ property and status code through _uploadStatus_
:::

#### UPLOADER_EVENTS.ITEM_PROGRESS

Triggered every time progress data is received for this file upload

- Parameters: _(item)_

:::info
progress info is accessed through the item's "completed" (percentage) and "loaded" (bytes) properties.
