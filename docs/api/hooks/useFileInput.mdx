## Package

**_[@rpldy/uploady](../../packages/rpldy-uploady)_**

## Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @rpldy/uploady
```

## Details

```typescript
type useFileInput = (fileInputRef?: InputRef) => InputRef
```

When customInput prop is set to true, Uploady will not create its own file input element.
In this case, Uploady will wait for a ref to an existing input.

The way you pass in your own input element is by using this hook.

In case Uploady wasn't provided with a destination prop or if it doesn't have a URL property,
Uploady will check whether the input resides in a form. It will then use the form's action and method to set the upload endpoint and request method.

:::note
In case the form's attributes were used for the upload destination, updating the form's attributes dynamically won't affect the uploader configuration once it was set.
:::

See [InputRef](../types#inputref) type.

## Example

```javascript title=WithCustomFileInputAndForm.jsx
import Uploady, { useFileInput } from "@rpldy/uploady";
import UploadButton from "@rpldy/upload-button";

const MyForm = () => {
    const inputRef = useRef();
    useFileInput(inputRef);

    return <form action="/upload" method="POST">
        <input type="file" name="testFile" style={{ display: "none" }} ref={inputRef}/>
    </form>;
};

export const WithCustomFileInputAndForm = () => {
    return <section>
        <Uploady
            debug
            customInput
        >
            <MyForm />
            <UploadButton/>
        </Uploady>
    </section>
};

```
:::info
This hook can also be used to retrieve Uploady's internal file input. Calling the hook without parameters will return the ref.
:::

## Internal Ref

```javascript
const inputRef = useFileInput();

if (inputRef.current) {
    inputRef.current.setAttribute("webkitdirectory", "true");
}
```

:::caution
This isn't the recommended, or the 'Reacty' way to do things. It is still recommended to pass along a ref to an input that you render.
In the future, accessing the internal input may have other consequences related to opting to interact with it directly instead of passing props to the Uploady component.
