## Package

- **_[@rpldy/abort](../../../packages/rpldy-abort)_**

## Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @rpldy/abort
```

## Details

```typescript
type getAbortEnhancer = () => UploaderEnhancer
```

- See: [UploaderEnhancer](../../types#uploaderenhancer)

Creates an uploader enhancer that adds the ability to abort uploads.
Abort can be done on all items at once, on a specific batch, or a single item.

### Normal vs. Fast Abort

When the number of pending/active uploads is less than the configured threshold ([fastAbortThreshold](../../../api#fastabortthreshold) param) or when the threshold is turned off (equals 0), _normal_ abort flow will be used.

In case the threshold is configured and the item count is equal or larger, the _fast_ abort flow will be used.

For All Abort, the threshold is compared against the total number of pending/active items
For Batch Abort, the threshold is compared against the number of pending/active items in the batch.

In both cases, finished items are ignored in the comparison.

#### Normal

**Normal** flow means that every item whether its already uploading or still pending will be individually aborted and an "ITEM_ABORT" event will be fired.
For abort all, "BATCH_ABORT" event will also be fired respectively.

#### Fast

**Fast** flow means that only active uploads are cancelled (typically very few as concurrent count is set to 1 by default).

Pending items are ignored and are simply removed from the queue by the uploader.
For abort all, "BATCH_ABORT" events will not be fired and no "ITEM_ABORT" event will be fired for pending items.
