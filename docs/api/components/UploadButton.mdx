In addition, most UploadOptions props can be passed to UploadButton, in order to override configuration passed to the parent Uploady component.
See [Uploady documentation](../..#props) for detailed list of upload options.

The following [guide](../../../guides/DifferentConfiguration) shows how different upload buttons may use different upload options.

:::note
Some options cannot be overridden by the button. For example, any prop that influences the file input directly (such as '_multiple_')
:::

## Example

```jsx
import React from "react";
import Uploady from "@rpldy/uploady";
import UploadButton from "@rpldy/upload-button";

const App = () => (<Uploady
    destination={{ url: "https://my-server/upload" }}>
    <UploadButton/>
</Uploady>);
```
