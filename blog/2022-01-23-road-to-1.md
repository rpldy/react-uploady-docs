Uploady has been out for just over a year now and succeeded far more than I had anticipated in terms of the value it brings and the user-base it gained.

<!-- truncate -->

During this time, there have been bugs reported and  features requested. Almost all were small or additive, and none required major overhauls or paradigm shifts. This has been very satisfying for me that the set of features and API decisions didn't need to change since its inception.

Seeing this, Id like to make Uploady officially ready for Production (despite already being used in Production by some).

If you have been using it in Production and haven't updated this **[discussion](https://github.com/rpldy/react-uploady/discussions/131)**, I'd love it if you could add your use-case & application/company name there.

The reason for this post is that I'd like to take the opportunity and ask you, Uploady users, to make your voice heard and **help me** decide if there is anything that should be added to this library before its API and functionality-set is determined as the official 1.0 version.

If you have ideas, requirements, or problems, speak now or forever hold you peace. Ok, not forever. You can always open an issue or a discussion. Major changes may have to wait for 2.0, though.

Thanks!
Yoav
