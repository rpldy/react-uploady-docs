Getting started with Uploady is very easy. You can get a simple upload flow in a matter of minutes.

```jsx title="Simple Example"
import React from "react";
import Uploady from "@rpldy/uploady";
import UploadButton from "@rpldy/upload-button";

const App = () => (
	<Uploady destination={{ url: "https://my-server.com/upload" }}>
		<UploadButton/>
	</Uploady>
);
```

In many cases you'd want a custom button or re-use a component you're already using. In this case you can wrap it with the handy `asUploadButton`:

```jsx title="With Custom Button"
import React from "react";
import Uploady from "@rpldy/uploady";
import { asUploadButton } from "@rpldy/upload-button";

const DivUploadButton = asUploadButton((props) => {
    return <div {...props} style={{ cursor: "pointer" }}>
        DIV Upload Button
    </div>
});

const App = () => (<Uploady
    destination={{ url: "https://my-server/upload" }}>
    <DivUploadButton/>
</Uploady>);

```

The code samples above show the very basic Uploady usage.

You can play around with this simple live example:

<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/react-uploady-intro-simple-32luv?autoresize=1&fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&module=%2Fsrc%2FApp.js&theme=dark"
     style={{ width:"100%", height: "500px", border:"0", borderRadius: "4px", overflow:"hidden" }}
     title="react-uploady intro simple"
     allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
     sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
   ></iframe>


Once you have Uploady in your app you can start thinking about more advanced flows. For example: Showing upload progress, cancelling running uploads, queuing, etc.

Many of these use-cases are described in the [Guides](../../guides) section and some can be explored in the live sandboxes below.
