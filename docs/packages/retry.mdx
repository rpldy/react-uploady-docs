## Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @rpldy/retry
```

## Details

Adds the capability to retry failed uploads.
Retry monitors items that have failed due to error or abort.

This package exposes an [UploaderEnhancer](../../getting-started/concepts#enhancer) that adds the retry extension.

For usage with your React app, see [@rpldy/retry-hooks](../rpldy-retry-hooks).

:::warning
Manual usage (outside React) is less practical as it requires familiarity with the internals of this package
which is unadvisable at the moment.
